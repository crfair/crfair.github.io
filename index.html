      <hr />
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a second year master's student studying
        Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology and
        an aspiring professional game developer. Since I was a kid, I have
        been fascinated by the power of stories, and to me, games are first
        and foremost a storytelling medium. I've also had a strong affinity for
        technology since I was young, and I love to write code! Video games are
        the perfect intersection of two of my greatest passions, and I have
        enjoyed them for as long as I can remember. Developing them has proven to
        be a rewarding experience, and I am working to find my place in the
        industry by the time I've finished my degree in spring of 2023!<br /><br />
        When I'm not in school or working on projects, I also love to play video games
        and table-top games. My favorite genre is RPGs, and some of my favorite
        series include The Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age and Mass Effect, The Legend
        of Zelda, and Dungeons and Dragons. I also like to play the piano, build PCs,
        make bead work, and hang out with my cat.

          <p>MTG Arena is a very popular online client version of the famous card 
             game, Magic: The Gathering. Over the course of a 10-week summer internship, 
             I was able to take complete ownership over a new feature for the game; 
             namely, the Set Collection feature. This feature allows players to see 
             the progress on their card collection by set, which are further broken 
             down by color and rarity. The feature also tracks both unique and 4x 
             collections; that is, once a player has one card of every set or metric 
             in a set, the meters tick over to tracking complete play sets, which is 
             4 copies of every card.<br /><br />
             As an intern, I worked as the sole programmer of this feature. I worked 
             with another intern who acted as my producer and reported to one of the 
             full-time engineers as well as the feature team lead. I was given a 
             design sheet and some UI prefabs and had 10 weeks to get as much done as 
             I could. I was able to get the feature to a near-complete state and, 
             at the end of my internship in mid-August., handed off the feature to the 
             full team who completed my work. The feature went live on October 6th, 2022.

          <p>Within These Walls is a narrative-driven horror game that is currently being 
            developed for my capstone project, a year-long project that is a requirement 
            for graduation from the master's degree. This game focused strongly on themes 
            such as self-fulfilling prophecy, the past coming to haunt the present, and 
            escaping destiny. Throughout the game, the house that the player explores will 
            react to the player's behaviors and actions, becoming either more or less haunted 
            depending on if the player acts as if it is and finds clues hinting one way or 
            the other. In the end, it is up to the player to decide what the truth is as they 
            can encounter two different endings based on their gameplay.<br /><br />
            For this game I act as a producer, programmer, and narrative writer. As a stand-in 
            for development while we build the encounters within the house, we also are using 
            a text adventure as a stand-in so that players are able to get the full game 
            experience, and writing this text adventure has been my responsibility. I also 
            keep our team of three on track with milestones and requirements for the class. 
            My main responsibility is as a programmer, though, and I've spent most of my time 
            importing and adapting Tansu Ergene's Horror Engine for our game and scripting 
            events for our players to discover.<br /><br />

          <p>Overcaste is a third-person exploration game that focuses strongly on 
             smooth movement and compelling world-building. It focuses on a desert-
             dwelling tribe of people who are being invaded by alien forces for reasons 
             unknown. It leans heavily on themes of the impacts of colonialism on 
             indigenous populations and seeks to lay bare those impacts on a 
             personal, individual level. The player navigates a huge desert map 
             with quick, effortless movement and pushes back the invading forces.<br /><br />
             For Overcaste, I work primarily as a narrative designer and world-builder. 
             I wrote the narrative bible for the game and designed several maps 
             that acted as development references. Additionally, I built out much of 
             the initial world, namely the town that the player starts in and the 
             area around it. I also assist with general programming when the need arises.

          <p>"Taste of Culture" was a school project made during Fall Semester
            2021 at RIT, and then later received funding from the MAGIC Maker 
            program to continue development over the summer of 2022. I, along 
            with my team Too Many Cooks, first developed this game from 
            September through December 2021 for IGME 601, Game
            Development Processes, a class which was about analyzing the
            processes that teams can use to effectively build a game and putting
            Agile philosophies into practice.<br /><br />
            Due to the focus of the class on processes, we were given some
            constraints in order to encourage us to consider our work efficiency,
            and we were also provided with an external stakeholder who provided
            additional requirements to be met. Our theme requirement was to
            create a game that promoted diversity; to that end, Taste of Culture
            strove to use food as a common ground: people of all cultures have
            an intimate but very culturally unique relationship with food, and
            cooking and eating is often a social activity over which bonding
            and understanding can happen. Our first level focused on Indian food,
            and our second level developed in the following summer on Caribbean food.

          <p>"Beauty" is a biological-technological art installation created by
            Dr. Carlos Castellanos, an artist, researcher, and professor at RIT.
            It has been in development since 2020, and I worked on the project as a 
            graduate research assistant from September 2021 to April 2022.<br /><br />
            As a graduate research assistant, I had weekly meetings with Dr.
            Castellanos regarding his vision for the project, the immediate next
            direction to take, and what technologies and methods I should look into
            using for this project. Primarily, I focused on computer vision and basic
            machine learning techniques, including OpenCV and openFrameworks, StyleGAN2,
            and OSC. I implemented these techniques in C++ and Python using Visual Studio
            and Google Colab, respectively.<br /><br />

          <p>"Watch Dog" was a 2 semester project developed as part of my computer
            engineering capstone requirement for my undergrad at CNU. I worked with
            a team of 4 other students to develop a prototype product that could
            conceivably be marketed as an off-the-shelf product.<br /><br />
            My role on the team was primarily as the front-end and database developer,
            as well as managing development for the data pipeline that would interface
            with either of these two things. I built a simple SQL server that would
            take in some basic data from two sources, as well as an ASP.NET web app
            that would manage the reading and writing of this data. Additionally,
            since our prospective client was a local SPCA which I had volunteered
            for in the past, I acted as a liaison between our team and the shelter
            for determining customer needs, problems that could be solved by our
            product, arranging meetings for testing and collecting data, and
            providing updates so that we could receive feedback.<br /><br />
