      <hr />
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a first year master's student studying
        Game Design and Development at Rochester Institute of Technology and
        an aspiring professional game developer. Since I was a kid, I have
        been fascinated by the power of stories, and to me, games are first
        and foremost a storytelling medium. I've also had a strong affinity for
        technology since I was young, and I love to write code! Video games are
        the perfect intersection of two of my greatest passions, and I have
        enjoyed them for as long as I can remember. Developing them has proven to
        be a rewarding experience, and I am working to find my place in the
        industry by the time I've finished my degree in spring of 2023!<br /><br />
        When I'm not in school or working on projects, I love to play video games
        and table top games as well. My favorite genre is RPGs, and some of my favorite
        series include The Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age and Mass Effect, The Legend
        of Zelda, and Dungeons and Dragons. I also like to play the piano, build PCs,
        make beadwork, and hang out with my cat.

          <p>"Taste of Culture" was a school project made during Fall Semester
             2021 at RIT. I, along with my team Too Many Cooks, developed this
             game from September through December 2021 for IGME 601, Game
             Development Processes, a class which was about analysing the
             processes that team can use to effectively build a game and putting
             Agile philosophies into practice.<br /><br />
             I was one of two technical leads on this project, which meant that
             I handled a lot of the programming work and acted as an advisor for
             my 5 teammates when technical questions came up. More specifically,
             I was the primary developer of the dialogue system, general scene
             scripting and transitions, implementing the gif tutorials, managing
             the web build, and taking care of general polish and bug fixing.<br /><br />
             Due to the focus of the class on processes, we were given some
             constraints in order to encourage us to consider our work efficiency,
             and we were also provided with an external stakeholder who provided
             additional requirements to be met. Our theme requirement was to
             create a game that promoted diversity; to that end, Taste of Culture
             strove to use food as a common ground: people of all cultures have
             an intimate but very culturally unique relationship with food, and
             cooking and eating is often a social activity over which bonding
             and understanding can happen. Our first level focused on Indian food,
             and further levels would focus on other cultures such as Korean,
             Carribean, Mexican, and many more. The other major constraints were that
             the project must be made in Unity, must have a web build, and each
             team member may spend no more than 3-4 hours a week working on the
             game. This significantly restrained the scope we would be able to
             implement, but in the end, we felt that we made a polished, mechanically
             sound game and I personally enjoyed the learning experience and am
             proud of the result.<br /><br />

          <p>"Seaon Soir√©e" was a rapid prototype assignment made during the Spring
            Semester 2022 at RIT. In this rapid prototyping course, teams are formed
            randomly and then given 2 weeks to design and develop a game meeting
            certain specifications.<br /><br />
            I took the role of team lead during this project, which meant that I
            acted as the design lead and I identified, prioritized, and delegated
            tasks to my team members based on their skillsets and work preferences.
            I also was the primary level designer and I participated in gameplay
            programming, primarily for the obstacles that the player can encounter
            and for an event system so that actors could react to the season-changing
            mechanic.<br /><br />
            The specifications given for this game included a working main menu
            and pause menu, an interesting theme, an unusual character that
            related to the theme, 3 different kinds of mobile actors, 3 different
            kinds of environmental effects, a level with multiple parts, and
            the game should be a platformer. This game's theme was seasons, and
            the aesthetics and the lore of the game were inspired by the Nordic
            legend of Yggdrasil and Mimir's Well. I leaned into the genre of
            puzzle platformer, mostly because of my preference for solving and
            designing puzzles, and with our unusual main character of a water droplet,
            he also has the unusual power to change form by changing the season
            between summer and winter. The environment changes along with him,
            though, so the player must be mindful of how their surroundings might
            change as well. Originally, we planned on having a limited amount of
            season changes that the player may make as well; time limits prevented
            this from being prioritized, but the player would've been encouraged
            to strategize carefully and inspect their surroundings before changing
            seasons. Though this game was only a 2 week prototype, I'm very proud
            of the leadership and design skills I was given the opportunity to exercise.<br /><br />

          <p>"Beauty" is a biological-technological art installation created by
            Dr. Carlos Castellanos, an artist, researcher, and professor at RIT.
            It has been in development since 2020, and I've been working on the
            project as a graduate research assistant since September 2021.<br /><br />
            As a graduate research assistant, I have weekly meetings with Dr.
            Castellanos regarding his vision for the project, the immediate next
            direction to take, and what technologies and methods I should look into
            using for this project. Primarily, I focus on computer vision and basic
            machine learning techniques, including OpenCV and openFrameworks, StyleGAN2,
            and OSC. I implement these techniques in C++ and Python using Visual Studio
            and Google Colab, respectively.<br /><br />
            This project is still in progress. The final vision of the project has yet
            to be determined or realized, but some projects I've worked on towards
            the development of this project include performing background subtraction
            and contour detection on images of bacteria using methods such as Canny
            and k Nearest Neighbor, Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagram
            generation on these contours, sending messages via OSC, and model training
            and latent space exploration with StyleGAN2.<br /><br />

          <p>"Watch Dog" was a 2 semester project developed as part of my computer
            engineering capstone requirement for my undergrad at CNU. I worked with
            a team of 4 other students to develop a prototype product that could
            conceivably be marketed as an off-the-shelf product.<br /><br />
            My role on the team was primarily as the front-end and database developer,
            as well as managing development for the data pipeline that would interface
            with either of these two things. I built a simple SQL server that would
            take in soome basic data from two sources, as well as an ASP.NET web app
            that would manage the reading and writing of this data. Additionally,
            since our prospective client was a local SPCA which I had volunteered
            for in the past, I acted as a liaison between our team and the shelter
            for determining customer needs, problems that could be solved by our
            product, arranging meetings for testing and collecting data, and
            providing updates so that we could receive feedback.<br /><br />
            The goal of Watch Dog was to remove some of the strain that dog shelters
            experience when they have a moderate number of rotating staff and volunteers:
            important information about the dogs, including behavioral patterns that
            could indicate potential illness, often falls through the cracks as it
            is extremely difficult to disseminate information about a large number of
            dogs to a large number of people. Illnesses such as kennel cough are
            extremely common in dog shelters as a result of this difficulty of noticing
            patterns and catching diseases early. Our proposed solution involved
            recording the dogs 24/7 using a small Raspberry Pi camera, sending the
            videos to a machine learning algorithm that could recognize the dogs'
            body parts and movement, and send this information to a database that
            displayed it on an internal web application. Shelther staff and volunteers
            would also be able to create and edit additional information about the
            dogs besides the movement data, so the app acted as a general database
            as well. The vision of the project was to eventually have the algorithm
            recognize and classify certain animal behaviors, such as excessive scratching,
            as cause for concern, such that the shelter staff could quickly identify
            and mitigate illness in the dogs. This project taught me a lot about
            working with external stakeholders and I'm proud of the work I did
            developing the interface while working with the shelter to understand
            the wants and needs of our customers.<br /><br />
